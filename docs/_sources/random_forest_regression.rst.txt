Algorithm Documentation: RandomForestRegression
================================================

This document provides an overview of the RandomForestRegression algorithm used for salary prediction in the LinkedOut project.

Overview
--------
RandomForestRegression is an ensemble learning method for regression tasks. It constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of the individual trees for regression problems.

Steps Involved
--------

1. **Input**: 
   - Features: Various features such as skills, education level, years of experience, etc.
   - Target variable: Salary.

2. **Process**:
   - The algorithm builds multiple decision trees using samples from the dataset.
   - Each tree learns from the dataset and makes predictions based on its learned patterns.
   - Predictions from individual trees are averaged to get a final prediction.
   - This method reduces overfitting and improves the predictive accuracy of the model.

3. **Usage in LinkedOut**:
   - **Salary Prediction**: Used to predict the salary of users based on their skills, education, and experience levels.
   - Helps in guiding users on expected earnings based on their profile and the projected job market.
